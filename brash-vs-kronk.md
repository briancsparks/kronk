# Kronk

A helper for all the development things I do. Knows where stuff is, how things
get laid-out, etc.


# Brash

Inspirations:

* When I am hunting down things, doing multiple commands in Bash, each subsequent command
  is a change to the verb, which is cumbersome (up-arrow, Ctl+A, DEL, type new verb.)
* Highlighting the output (REs highlighted, and remembered.)
* All output remembered, and not just as one big text dump -- remember each command and the
  output it generated.
* Wash
* Multiple sets of 'ambient' vars like PWD to help / enable working in multiple 'places'
  at the same time.

## Features

* Omega
